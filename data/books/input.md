**Introduction**

You have enough on your hands already. Now you have “managing the fleet”
dumped in your lap, which puts you in a bind since you never signed up
to manage the fleet in the first place, and you have very little
know-how when it comes to automotive stuff. Plus, you still have to get
all your other work done!

If you’re like most of our clients, you have enough worries on your
plate to ensure everything in the business is running smoothly. You
can’t take on another project, especially one this large, that has the
probability of costing the company thousands of dollars in repairs,
overages, and gas. The list goes on.

That’s where we come in. Recently, we helped a company drive down the
cost per mile from 48 cents to 36 cents per mile by showing them how
they could run their vehicles longer for more mileage and reduce their
total investment in that vehicle, thus lowering the cost per mile.

> Profitable Fleet Management 1

They were replacing their vehicles every 100,000 miles. We showed them
how much they could save by extending the mileage to double and triple,
reaching a cool quarter of a million dollars.

Fleet owners face many problems. Some of the toughest are when you come
into work and have a ton of service calls, and the vehicle you need to
perform those services is down or will not start.

One of the other issues is when you have somebody out on the road doing
service calls with a critical breakdown, and the driver is stuck along
the side of the road with the vehicle, and they can’t make the calls
needed to have a tow service get them. Now that employee is left in an
unproductive state (no money) for the day. It doesn’t have to be that
way.

By finishing this book, you’ll understand how to align costs and
maintenance practices to achieve absolute peace within your fleet
management practices.

My passion is helping businesses put more money in their pockets to pay
their employees better, and pay themselves better, and ultimately have a
more peaceful life with uninterrupted business by ensuring the fleet is
always

running. This book will help you either do it yourself, find somebody to
do it with you, or find somebody to do it for you.

Now, let’s get a move on.

> *Bill*

> Profitable Fleet Management 3

Chapter One

**Fleet** **Accounting:** **P&L** **Lies**

Many small businesses don’t have a good handle on their accounting
practices. They look at the bottom line and see that they made a \$5,000
profit, let’s say, for one month. They don’t look at the offset of that.
Maybe they have equipment loans that they are paying principal and
interest on.

A good example would be somebody operating a larger-size suite, say 15
vehicles, and they’re making a payment on a vehicle loan for those
vehicles. That principal payment does not show up on the profit and loss
statement. The interest portion does, but the principal doesn’t. On a
\$5,000 payment, maybe \$1,000 is interest, the other \$4,000 is
principal. That means you need to make that \$4,000 principal payment,
which shows up on the balance sheet, out of the business's profits.

4 Bill DeBoer

Say that business showed a \$5,000 profit, but with that \$5,000
payment, \$4,000 going to principal, you would only have \$1,000 in free
cash flow after that payment is made. That’s how the P&L lies.

**Don’t** **Get** **Me** **Wrong**

Businesses should be operating on the P&L. That’s the most important way
a business should be operated, but they need to have an awareness of the
fallacy that’s in there. If there are debt payments specifically, the
debt or the principal portion of the debt payments needs to come out of
the business's net profits. It’s even more important that they’re
looking at the profit and loss, and managing their business on that
versus the usual iteration, one of business ownership, which is managing
by checkbook.

That’s a whole other problem that people get into by managing their
money out of their checkbook instead of their P&L. What happens there is
they will have a bunch of jobs to get paid for, and they look at their
checkbook and think they have a ton of money in it, and they go out and
buy a new boat or new truck. The

> Profitable Fleet Management 5

following week, all the bills are associated with the revenues to
generate money in the checking account. Suddenly, they’re in arrears
because the checkbook manages them instead of the P&L.

It’s almost like that old saying of the man who looks at his checkbook
with checks left over, so he must have money in there.

**The** **Difference** **between** **Capitalizing** **versus**
**Expensing** **Equipment**

Depending on your phase, you will need to show more profits for the
lenders as you're growing it. If you need a building or construction
loan to build a new building, or as you’re growing the business, you
need to take out lines of credit and show a good profit and loss
statement to the bank.

There are two ways of owning fleets. You can purchase them and have a
loan on them, or you can lease the fleets. Typically, with an equipment
lease, you have a dollar amount buyout at the end. That’s what we’re
talking about when we speak about capitalizing. That

6 Bill DeBoer

would be taking the fleet, booking it as an asset on the balance sheet,
and using a traditional loan structure. Because again, going back to how
the P&L lies, the principal portion will be hitting the balance sheet,
leaving more profit showing on the P&L versus if you have a lease
payment, the entire lease payment is expensed.

Consider the example we discussed previously: the person had a \$5,000
payment on their lease or fleet. If \$5,000 were a lease payment, 100%
of that would hit the P&L as an expense; therefore, that \$5,000 profit
showing would be completely eclipsed. It’d be zeroed out. The bank would
ask, “How will we lend you money when this business doesn’t make monthly
profits?”

That’s why it’s very important to understand where you’re at in your
business and your objectives as you grow. There are use cases. Again,
I’m not an accountant. You should refer to your accountant during these
discussions, but there is a time and place to put all of your equipment
on lease and expense regularly.

> Profitable Fleet Management 7

**Debt** **Payments** **Rob** **Cash**

The debt payments robbing cash goes back to what I was talking about
with the profit and loss lying to you. It shows that you have cash, but
the cash isn’t there because it ends up on the balance sheet when you
make principal payments on a loan.

**P** **&** **L** **Tip**

The biggest tip is to have good, clean, accurate books. You want all the
expenses in the P&L to line up with the month it occurred. An example
would be a plumber who does a boiler job in month one but doesn’t
account for it until they get paid in month two when the revenue comes
in. They want to bill it out in the month it occurred, carry that as a
receivable into month two, and apply it back so that it doesn’t skew all
their numbers.

**Action** **Step** **for** **You**

An action step for this would be to ensure that you have a bookkeeper
running very efficiently and timely. You want to have a good P&L in

8 Bill DeBoer

your hands by the 10th of the following month for your review. The
easiest way to do a P&L review is to break it down by percentage of
income. Then you can go through and see where you’re trending with your
KPIs concerning projections. How much was your fuel bill for that month?
What percentage of sales? When fuel starts going crazy, as we’ve
experienced recently, that will swing a lot more than in the past. You
want to have a good idea of what range you’re in and then start to
charge your customers accordingly so that you can keep all of that in
mind and still make the net profit the business requires to continue its
growth.

**One** **Thing** **to** **STOP** **Doing** **Right** **Now**

Stop managing your fleet by the checkbook.

> Profitable Fleet Management 9

Chapter Two **Understanding** **Cash** **Flow**

Cash is the lifeblood of business. Without cash, it won’t exist, and
many small businesses could get into a lot of trouble when they don’t
have good cash reserves. The number one way to do that is to ensure you
have a good P&L and manage the business using the profit and loss
statement.

**Go** **with** **Profit** **First**

I would refer you to the book *Profit* *First* by Mike Michalowicz. He
lays out a detailed system there, which I can cover.

The idea behind *Profit* *First* is to flip the general accounting
principle of gap accounting; income minus expenses equals profit. He
turns it around, so income minus profit equals expenses. It goes hand in
hand with Hutchinson’s theory of resources. It's like when

10 Bill DeBoer

you get down to the last of the toothpaste; you make that last little
bit work every single time.

That’s what Michalowicz wants you to do with the expenses. He wants you
to take out the profit and pay the bills with whatever’s left. That way,
you live within what’s left over, and you’ve already preprogrammed the
profits into your business. The way he does that is to break it down,
allocating your income across four, five, or six different accounts
according to percentages for those allocations.

If you want to run a 10% profit, you will take your revenues, and again,
it’s not your sales; it’d be off the money you collected. Then you would
say, “If I collected \$30,000 in revenues last week, we’re going to take
10% of that and put it into the income account,” so three grand goes
there. You would allocate to your expenses mostly payroll and your
materials.

You would also have a tax account set up so that you are pre-planning
for your taxes and allocating for all of them. Then you’d have an
operating expense account to pay your general expenses. It’s like an old
envelope system that some older people use where they stick cash in
envelopes and open it when needed. If you plan

> Profitable Fleet Management 11

and run your business with Profit First, it should be there when you
need the money to pay the bills because you’ve already allocated for
them.

**The** **“Profit** **First”** **Difference**

As you grow, you go through these growth periods, and you don’t always
realize their tax implications, so they sneak up on you. With the Profit
First system in place, it's no big shocker when the tax bill comes, and
the money is there to pay it. There’s no sweat in how you will pay this
huge tax bill you weren’t expecting.

It goes back to the P&L standpoint, too. Maybe you made \$100,000 but
didn’t have \$100,000 in cash.

**Good** **Cash** **Flow** **=** **Negotiating** **Power**

You can negotiate prepayment discounts with your vendors as you create a
good cash flow and manage your money. A lot of times, your payment terms
could be two net tens, where you get 2% off if you pay within ten days
of being billed, which could result in significant savings.

12 Bill DeBoer

Then it buys you more credibility with your vendors, so you can even
negotiate more because they understand that you’ll always have the money
there. They know they won’t be hung out to dry and are getting paid
quickly. It allows them the cash they need to operate within their
business.

**Fuel** **Card** **Programs**

There are several different fuel card programs out there. But when
operating a fleet, it’s very important to utilize one of those programs
because they’ll give you detailed reporting on your fuel cost. They’re
going to break it down. I don’t want to say geo fence, but you can limit
the gas stations where your drivers can fill up so that they are only
filling up at the fuel stations that you prefer, maybe those with lower
price points. They’re not rolling into whatever is the most convenient
for them. The other thing is paying with a fuel card versus a
traditional Visa or MasterCard. They have programs typically associated
with Visa or MasterCard, which carry a higher cost to the gas provider,
who will pass that on to you, the consumer. Using a fuel

> Profitable Fleet Management 13

card, they usually negotiate lower rates at the pump.

There are also ways to be creative. A friend told me about a guy who
owns a construction company that buys all of the Home Depot cards at the
grocery store that gives him free fuel, and then he fills up his trucks
with all the fuel points.

**A** **Personal** **Story**

Once we implemented Profit First, we talked about freedom from worrying
about where the money is coming from to pay the bills because the money
is already there and allocated for it. You can track much quicker when
you’re running into pain points where you’re struggling with sales.
It’ll be way more apparent what your cash flow position is and more
instantaneously in real-time than if you wait for the monthly P&L, which
comes out later.

Those profit and loss statements are lagging indicators. It’s already
over. What happened four weeks ago is not telling you what’s happening
this afternoon.

14 Bill DeBoer

When you’re managing the business numbers weekly, you get to see a
weekly snapshot. It evens out the day-to-day ebbs and flows of the
business, but it’s enough of a capture where you have real-time data
that you can work with. We run everything into the quarter. We have 13
weeks in a quarter, so everything’s broken down into a weekly report,
then rolled up into a monthly report, and then ultimately to a quarterly
report. That’s how we run our business.

**Your** **Action** **Step**

Read *Profit* *First* and implement it in your business.

**Stop** **Doing** **Step**

It goes back to the same old thing, managing from the checkbook. Because
you have money in the checking account doesn’t mean that it’s available
for you to go buy a boat.

> Profitable Fleet Management 15

Chapter Three

**Major** **KPI’s-TCO** **and** **CPO**

A bank called Corporate Billing offers something called cbCharge. This
bank deals specifically with fleets. They extend credit terms based on
the size of the business and its creditworthiness. Corporate Billing
allows a business to open up a charge account where they can partner
with thousands of repair shops for their repair and maintenance needs.

The reward of using cbCharge is consolidated billing across your fleet.
If you run all your repairs through cbCharge, you’ll have a nice monthly
statement showing you exactly how much you’re spending on repairs and
maintenance for your fleet.

When you sign up for it, you can set the account limit to whatever you
feel comfortable with. Then, whether POs or approvals over certain
dollar amounts are required, they have complete control over the
spending with that account. The nicest thing is that it allows you to
consolidate

16 Bill DeBoer

and reconcile your monthly transactions in one easy spot, especially if
you’re running a fleet covering a large territory where you may be going
to multiple service providers.

Say you were using your company credit card to pay for your maintenance.
You’d have to dive in and separate what was repaired, paying the
electric bill, and all the other transactions that occur within a credit
card statement. This is one consolidated bill of all the fleet
maintenance and services.

**The** **True** **Cost** **of** **Ownership** **(TCO)**

Businesses might not be properly accounting for the KPIs. Many fleet
managers are trying to control the costs, but they don’t have a good
handle on the costs themselves. cbCharge is a very important tool so
that they can have one easy spot to go to and fully understand the
repair cost of their fleet. The other nice thing with cbCharge is they
link up to some fleet management software and the fuel cards we
discussed earlier so that the fuel cards and cbCharge charges all
consolidate into one spot

> Profitable Fleet Management 17

within a fleet program. You can start to automate your fleet management
practices.<img src="./lu2k1pph.png" style="width:3.5in;height:1.84722in" />

The True Cost of Ownership (TCO) for fleets is one of the main KPIs you
should be tracking as a fleet operator. The total cost of ownership is a
comprehensive topic. It must be understood to manage your fleet
properly. Fleet expenses are broken down into fixed and variable
expenses.

**Fixed** **Expenses**

Fixed expenses are predetermined regardless of asset usage. We can break
this down a little bit further and give examples. Good examples of fixed
costs associated with the fleet would be the purchase of the vehicle,
the depreciation associated with the vehicle, any loan or lease

18 Bill DeBoer

payments, insurance, permits, licensing, taxes that are paid on the
vehicles, and upfitting or wrapping that vehicle to get it out in the
fleet.

**Variable** **Costs**

Variable costs will change depending on the fleet's size, usage, and
overall efficiency. The variable cost is the fuel, which we covered with
the fuel cards, the maintenance service and repairs for which we
suggested using cbCharge to get a handle on, and then tolls or other
sorts of replacements as the vehicle is being used.

When you talk about operating a fleet, 26% of it goes to fuel, 38% to
depreciation, and maintenance encompasses 10% of total costs. From
there, it breaks down into smaller pieces: management fees, taxes,
licenses, insurance, interest, etc. The median maintenance cost for
somebody operating a vehicle is \$2,600 annually.

That’s the maintenance and servicing end of things for a vehicle. The
other side of it that we talked about is the fuel cost. What we see in

> Profitable Fleet Management 19

annual fuel cost depends on the asset, but they’re spending about
\$5,700 a year on
fuel.<img src="./2be1xy5g.png" style="width:3.5in;height:2.33333in" />

Now that we understand what the total cost of ownership looks like and
what we’re measuring, we can dive deeper into calculating your cost per
mile, also known as CPM. It’s the most important number that a fleet
operator or manager should be focused on because it’s the average cost
per mile to operate the vehicle. Understanding the company’s cost per
mile is an important tool. It will help you make better business
decisions in several different areas. Once we talk about the cost per
mile, we can get into how it’s calculated and then talk about what
decisions you can make that affect that.

20 Bill DeBoer

**Better** **or** **Worse**

The cost per mile equation is your cost divided by your mileage. For
example, we discussed average repair costs were \$2,600 a year. If we
divide that cost by an average of 20,000 miles, that will put you at 13
cents per mile to operate that vehicle a year. That would be as far as
services, and then you can combine the fuel and the repair. These are
the variable costs associated with it. You can split this up in several
different ways, but getting your head wrapped around these variable
costs and what it costs to operate in general will go a long way to
understanding whether you’re making money or not making money within
that business.

**Work** **Your** **Way** **Backwards**

Now you can retrofit it. You look to see what all the costs are. Once
you get that figured out, you know what you need to make every quarter,
every month, every week, and every day.

> Profitable Fleet Management 21

**A** **Client** **Success** **Story**

We need to talk a little bit about telematics because that’s how we
track mileage, and maybe we need to unpack mileage a little bit, too. We
talked about how to track the cost associated with fuel cards and
cbCharge. The other part of the equation is the mileage. You need to be
able to track the mileage. Otherwise, you can’t do the math on that
equation. Telematics is a very big piece of that.

There are many ways people solve the telematics on vehicles nowadays.
You can have an OBD2 plugin device. They also have hardwired devices
remotely located on a vehicle, so they can’t be tampered with, that will
track the mileage. There’s also camera equipment that can be involved
with telematics. That will be your primary information source for
collecting your miles traveled, outside of manually tracking it, which
is too hard for everybody to do. It’s so very important to have a
telematics program that works. It also removes human error.

22 Bill DeBoer

We all hope our employees are on top of things. When we get into
telematics, there are several different providers out there, and they
all do a lot of the same things. There’s very little differentiation
amongst the various products out
there.<img src="./es5ezrsl.png" style="width:3.5in;height:1.90625in" />

We talked about driving habits. Once we plug into the vehicle's OBD2
connector, they capture the live data stream that the vehicle operates
on. We can see who’s a good, safe driver. We can see where the problem
areas are. We can geolocate these vehicles. We get start/stop reports
coming out of telematics. We can find out where people are spending
their time, whether they’re lingering somewhere they shouldn’t be, if
they’re on the job longer than they reported to be on the job, or if
they were not on the job when they reported being on the

> Profitable Fleet Management 23

job. Telematics goes a long way to solve a host of those problems and
also gathers the data we need to calculate CPM.

**A** **Red** **Flag** **to** **Watch** **For**

The biggest thing to start with is a good baseline assessment of your
location. The best way to do that would be to take a rolling 12-month
period and start calculating expenses, and then see what areas you can
improve upon to start driving that number lower. You can’t look over one
month on its own. You need to have it averaged out over 12 months and
calculate how many miles you drove your entire fleet for those 12 months
and the total costs to operate that fleet within that period. You can
figure out your cost per mile based on that.

24 Bill DeBoer

Chapter Four

**Hedging** **Against** **Major** **Repairs**

The number one way to hedge against major repairs is to have a good
driver inspection program coupled with a comprehensive preventative
maintenance program.

When we talk about driver inspections, we want to see them done as
frequently as the fleet requires. We don’t want to have this get in the
way of productivity, but at the same time, it has to be frequent enough
that it catches problems before they happen.

A good driver inspection will be a full walk around the vehicle,
checking all its major components, doing an under-hood survey, checking
fluid levels, and then documenting. Ideally, this is all done
electronically. That also lends itself to picture taking so that we can
have a documented paper trail of the vehicle's condition and what the
problem areas look like that the drivers are calling out.

> Profitable Fleet Management 25

We have a visual inspection reported, not the driver making a note.
There’s an accompanying picture to go with that. Again, we are removing
human error with our processes for managing fleets every step along the
way. Part of our superpower is taking out the chance for human error. No
matter how much your drivers mean well, they write a little note that
gets stuck to the bottom of their shoes when they get out to eat.

The other thing with the checklist is that it’s done intentionally. They
may be checking boxes just to get the checklist done so they can get out
there. An electronic system won’t let them finish the checklist before
they have looked at everything and leave it incomplete.

**Daily** **and** **Weekly** **Driver** **Inspections**

The inspection should also be available should something come up. Say a
driver did their weekly or daily driver’s inspection, whatever the
frequency is for that business. Should they be driving down the road
when the check engine light comes on, or they start hearing a noise,
they can instantly pull out an inspection

26 Bill DeBoer

form and start to report this as an issue to get tracked and have it
serviced before it leads to a much more major breakdown or expensive
repair.

**Making** **It** **Personal**

We like to look at the inspections on a personalized level. Someone with
a fleet that’s hauling a tonnage versus somebody with a fleet that
delivers lab results would have different things they’d be looking for.
Don’t get me wrong. A vehicle's operation is operation, but different
use cases will dictate how often they’re looked at and what exactly is
looked at.

**Hedging** **Against** **Major** **Repairs**

One way to help with preventative maintenance and hedging against major
repairs is to partner up with Valvoline. That provides us with a
solution called Valvoline Professional Services, which carries a
warranty with it. All the necessary fluids, the coolant, transmission,
power steering, brake fluid, and fuel system, have different services.
Valvoline believes so much in its product that it will warranty against

> Profitable Fleet Management 27

major critical breakdowns of those components if those services are done
properly.

The first thing we go to, for example, is the transmission. If you have
a transmission serviced with their VPs transmission service on or before
50,000 miles, you’ll get \$4,000 in warranty coverage for that
transmission should it fail. If you have a vehicle serviced before
50,000 and then every 30,000 after that, you’ll maintain a \$4,000
warranty should that transmission fail. That’s very, very good
insurance.

They can do that because preventative maintenance works. If you’re
putting new fluid in there, you’re putting their cleaning and
conditioning products in there. They believe so much in their product
that they will guarantee it with that \$4,000 warranty. They’ve paid out
claims, and we’ve had several situations where they have paid stuff out,
not so much with the major component of the transmission.

That’s always the big, scary unknown that is a big expense for a fleet
operator. We discussed transmission first, but the more practical one is
the cooling system. Many components are

28 Bill DeBoer

associated with the fuel or the cooling system. You have a radiator. You
have a thermostat. You have a water pump and hoses. There’s a whole host
of things that go into a cooling system on a vehicle. We’ve had several
vehicles where the thermostat or the water pump will go bad, and
Valvoline comes in and pays that repair bill for that
customer.<img src="./4waqwec1.png" style="width:3.5in;height:2.8in" />

**Managing** **a** **Fleet** **as** **an** **Afterthought**

When the person managing the fleet has several other responsibilities,
and the fleet management goes to the back burner, you get into trouble.

> Profitable Fleet Management 29

Neglecting simple things like driver inspections, picking up low or
dirty oil conditions, low transmission fluid, or an empty coolant
container can all lead to catastrophic failures within major components
like an engine or the transmission.

I’ve seen this in several fleets out there. They go miles and miles
between oil changes, and the next thing you know, a vehicle doesn’t have
any oil in it, and the engine seizes. Now you’re talking a five, 10,
\$15,000 repair bill for an engine replacement versus the \$80 oil
change they could have done. It can turn into a nightmare quickly.

When you’re actively managing your fleet, have the right tools, track
your cost per mile, and actively stay in front of everything, you have a
much easier life as far as fleets go. You don’t come into the dramas
with 911 calls or somebody's vehicle broken down on the side of the
road. Everything is pre-planned and happens according to a scheduled
service, and it doesn’t interrupt or disrupt your business.

30 Bill DeBoer

The crazy thing is you can have management that is so far back on the
back burner that their management means scheduling oil changes and
ensuring the trucks get washed weekly. That would be all the
management’s responsibility.

**My** **Concern** **for** **You**

My major concern is that when the fleet isn’t actively managed properly,
it’ll lead to chaos in the business and your life. It’s going to disrupt
your business. It’s going to disrupt your employees. It will lead to
major expenses and loss of income, which is a double whammy. When you
blow an engine, you’re paying an employee to sit on the side of the road
waiting for a tow truck, and he has to get towed back to the shop and
get a ride back to the store and try to get out in another piece of
equipment. There’s lost time and revenue on top of major expenses, and
it’s a bad spot to be in when managing a fleet.

> Profitable Fleet Management 31

Chapter Five **Income** **per** **Vehicle**

Now that we’ve covered all the costs associated with the vehicle, you
need to grasp what your income is per vehicle. What does that vehicle
generate for you in income daily, weekly, or monthly? When you
understand that you can put that against your cost to operate the
vehicle, labor, and materials cost, you can dive into the numbers and
know what you’re making in real time. This goes back to managing the
business for efficiency and cash flow.

It goes back to the income we talked about in the last chapter. Say the
truck on the road is worth \$5,000 a day in income, and the truck breaks
down and ends up in the shop. The driver misses half or the whole day.
That’s \$5,000 plus whatever the repair bill was for that day.
Understanding income by vehicle is a very important metric.

32 Bill DeBoer

I guess we could get into how you would figure out what your income by
vehicle would be. That would be dividing your total income by your
number of vehicles, which would give you that metric. You can easily
solve that and understand your revenue opportunities with those
vehicles.

**Missing** **Revenue** **Opportunities**

If a fleet manager doesn’t know about vehicle revenue opportunities,
it’s very easy to see it fall by the wayside. If they don’t quite
understand, they get busy trying to take care of little things or not
fully optimizing the revenue opportunity with each vehicle by setting a
KPI goal for what your income revenue targets are for the vehicle. It
falls by the wayside very quickly.

**Set** **Up** **Revenue** **Goals**

It will be all over the map, depending on the industry. Every industry
has different revenue sizes associated with fleets, but you work
backward. You need to figure out what the capacity of the business is.

> Profitable Fleet Management 33

This is the tool you’re going to use to measure growth because, as we
talked about growing the fleet to match the business, this is the number
you want to key in on. If your goal is \$5,000 a day in revenue per
vehicle, and you do the math and run that \$7,000 or \$8000 a day in
revenue, maybe it’s time for another vehicle. That’s your opportunity to
pull the trigger and add vehicles to the fleet to help expand your
revenue. Conversely, where is the shortfall with that if you're running
below target? Why isn’t that vehicle producing more? Maybe it’s time to
downsize the fleet to bring your expenses into line to match the income
that you’re making.

Also, we want to go back to earlier chapters when we discussed the OBD.
Maybe the drivers are not at the job when they were supposed to be,
stopping off at their house or making multiple trips to get parts.

34 Bill DeBoer

Chapter Six

**Vehicle** **Acquisition**

Vehicle acquisition is a huge point of operating a fleet. The first
thing you want to do is make sure that you are in the manufacturer fleet
purchase plans to take advantage of all the benefits. All the
manufacturers, for the most part, except some like Honda, typically all
have fleet purchase plans. You have to meet certain qualifications to
get a fleet number. Still, once you get that number, it’ll open up
several opportunities for reduced pricing, better financing, etc.

**Buying** **vs.** **Leasing**

Depending on how you operate your business, you should talk to your
accountant and strategize the best way to operate your fleet. If you do
traditional leasing, you expense everything as you go with your
payments.

> Profitable Fleet Management 35

One of the good things is that it can spread out cash flow. As you make
those regular payments monthly, it’s very predictable. You expense it as
you go versus buying where you would put the asset on your balance sheet
and then depreciate it.

There are certain instances in which your accountant will want you to do
that. If you have a very good year, a good accountant might have you go
out and buy a few vehicles to qualify for the tax deduction. They can
depreciate those vehicle purchases and dispose of some of that taxable
income. That’s a discussion for you to have with your accountant, but
those are some strategies you can run around buying versus leasing the
vehicles in your fleet.

**Paying** **Cash**

If you have the cash, it helps as far as pricing goes. The more vehicles
you buy, the more savings you’ll see.

36 Bill DeBoer

**Key** **Points** **to** **Remember**

When you work with a partner like me or a fleet manager, typically, they
will get involved in negotiating these deals for you, helping you
acquire the vehicles, and helping you get them outfitted. They’ll also
help get the fleet numbers you want in place so that you can take
advantage of the different fleet programs that the manufacturers have.
That’s the biggest thing that we have to offer with vehicle acquisition.

> Profitable Fleet Management 37

Chapter Seven **Risk** **Mitigation**

**In-House** **or** **Outsourcing**

The number one thing with operating a fleet is mitigating your risk. All
it takes is one accident with a bus full of children to destroy a
business quickly. When you’re looking at mitigating your risk, you’re
taking care of your preventive maintenance and safety checks and keeping
your inspections complete and up to date.

One of the biggest things we see is that sometimes people, especially
businesses that are new or starting out or at a smaller level, try to do
their maintenance and repairs in-house versus having a repair shop or
somebody else do it. The struggle is that when that accident occurs,
they will go back and tear that vehicle apart. They’re going to go
through all the service records on that vehicle, and if you have a
non-qualified person doing the repairs, it doesn’t shift the burden. It
keeps it all on the business.

38 Bill DeBoer

If they’re doing the repairs in-house, that ultimately ends up on the
business. If you outsource repairs to a reputable repair shop, you want
to ensure that that repair shop has adequate insurance coverage. They
typically will get you a certificate of insurance with your fleet listed
as an additional insured. That’s the best way to mitigate the risk. That
way, should a vehicle get into an accident, there should be a paper
trail of all those invoices and insurance enforced on that repair shop
to pay for any damages associated with their neglect. It helps to spread
the risk across multiple parties versus putting it all on the business
you’re trying to operate.

**Stepping** **over** **Dollars** **to** **Get** **to** **Pennies**

Typically, smaller operators think that they’re saving 50 bucks on a
brake job if they do it in-house when, in reality, they’re opening
Pandora’s Box for one of these nightmare scenarios.

It’s like insurance when we’re talking about risk mitigation. Unless you
face that scenario, you don’t know what you’re saving, but the biggest

> Profitable Fleet Management 39

thing is the peace of mind of knowing that you have the awareness when
you’re operating your vehicles.

You go from one to two to three vehicles and say that they’re all doing
anywhere from 10 to 20,000 miles a year. You’re suddenly going from
20,000 miles of exposure to 60,000 miles of exposure, and then you
double that again, and now you’re up to 120,000 miles of exposure. Every
little step of growth leads to a much greater chance of a nightmare
scenario.

As risk increases, shift the burden by ensuring the vehicle is serviced
properly with a reputable repair shop vendor that has full insurance and
can provide the details and add you as an additional insured on that
policy.

**Driver** **Risk** **Mitigation**

Going back to telematics, they typically have driver report cards you
can produce with their reporting. They’ll give you harsh driving
reports, where you can see who’s driving aggressively and who’s
overusing the brakes. This not only applies to the risk management

40 Bill DeBoer

piece of the puzzle, but it also comes to the wear and tear on the
vehicle. You’ll find that the person who’s driving more aggressively
will consume more gas, will burn through brakes more quickly, and you’ll
have increased operating costs or increased cost per mile on those types
of drivers.

You can create these reports, sit down, review them with the driver, and
help make a plan for them to get on a better driving track. The other
thing that you want to be doing is constantly running driver history
abstracts. I see this a lot with fleets. They’ll hire somebody, and the
day they hire them, they’ll pull his driver’s abstract and never pull
another one again.

Meanwhile, they don’t know that maybe the guy was involved in a fatal
accident. Anybody involved in a fatal accident has a higher propensity
to have another accident after that. Suppose you’re not pulling these
driver abstracts to see who’s getting speeding tickets, getting a DWI,
or getting into other traffic accidents or violations. In that case, it
could quickly become a threat to your operation or your fleet.

> Profitable Fleet Management 41

Something else you can do is go through safety training with the
drivers, especially in today’s day and age with cell phones. Who’s
looking at cell phones instead of driving like they’re supposed to be?
There are good safety programs out there. Typically, suppose you’re
operating a fleet and have commercial insurance on the fleet. In that
case, the insurance company will give you discounts showing that you put
your drivers through a safety training program.

Accompanying that would be accident reporting. Should you have an
accident with the vehicle, you want to make sure that the vehicle's
driver is trained on how to capture all the details of that accident
when it happens. That is a very important component of managing a
successful fleet.

Drivers need to know how to act and respond, ensure all the information
is collected at the scene, take pictures, and mirror or collect their
report, or the insurance company can help them fix that situation.

42 Bill DeBoer

**Safety** **Compliance**

Regarding safety compliance with state and federal regulations, you want
to ensure that you’re operating the vehicles within the guidance of
those agencies to which you are subject. Several different regulatory
bodies are out there, whether it’s a state emissions inspection or a DOT
safety inspection. You want to ensure that you comply with them all
because, whether in a roadside traffic stop or in an accident scenario,
you want to ensure that everything complies. Otherwise, they’ll come
down on you even harder as far as the penalties go.

**Something** **to** **STOP** **Doing** **Immediately**

Stop trying to save money and being foolish by cutting corners with
maintenance and safety issues.

**Here’s** **How** **We** **Can** **Help** **You**

In the first meeting, we will get together and do a fact-finding
session. We’ll get a handle on your fleet, size, and operating
equipment. Typically, if it’s available, we like to sample the fleet by
doing visual inspections on them and getting a baseline assessment of
where you’re at and your maintenance and life journey in the fleet.

**My** **Hope** **for** **You**

I hope that you can either implement a fleet management program
internally or find a good partner to work with to dial in your expenses
and grow the business even more and live life uninterrupted.

You would think that was self-evident, but usually, companies are
unintentionally giving it away.

If you’re like most of our clients, you have enough worries on your
plate to ensure everything in the business is running smoothly. You
don’t have the bandwidth to take on another project, especially one this
large, that has the probability of costing the company thousands of
dollars in repairs, overages, and gas. The list goes on.

Recently, we helped a company drive their cost from 48 cents per mile
down to 36 cents per mile by showing them how they could run their
vehicles longer for more mileage and reduce their total investment in
that vehicle, thereby lowering the cost per mile. They were replacing
their vehicles every 100,000 miles. We showed them how much they could
save by extending the mileage to double and triple, reaching a cool

60 Bill DeBoer
